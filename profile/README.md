We are the people you call when you need:

- Zephyr RTOS implementations that don't just `while true` your battery to death.
- Embedded Linux builds that don't violate CRA.
- Hardware. Just hardware. That does what it's supposed to do. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Warning: May contain traces of rigorous testing and actual product lifecycle management.

Stack: Zephyr | Embedded Linux | C | Solder | Patience
